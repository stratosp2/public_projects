The aim of this pedagogic project was to check whether the 
news sentiment can predict the price, or return of bitcoin
on a daily basis. It is not to be used as a trading and/or
investment indicator, but rather as an interesting exercise
to check if news affect this area of the stock market, and 
specifically bitcoin. 

A scrapper gets the news via google since 2017. Warning:
re-compiling could lead to high frequency requests on google
and several "human verifications" will be needed.

Another script builds the feeling database reading the news
from each day and extracting sentiments. A R script pulls
and writes the bitcoin. Finally, a python script merges these
data and performs data analysis. Correlations are observed, 
but whether those can be trusted or not, is left as an exercise
to the reader. A shell script, binds all together.
