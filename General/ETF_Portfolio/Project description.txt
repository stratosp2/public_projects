We deploy an algorithm to create an ETF portfolio with exposure 
to Fama-French factors: Mkt-RF, SMB and HML with statistical significance.
We compare our portfolio with the S&P 500 index and we check performance 
since February 2015. The reason we do not go more back in the past is 
because for some of the ETfs, e.g ZPRX we have data since Feb 2015 
from yahoo finance.
