The task of this project was to capture characteristics of batteries behaviour, 
if possible establish relations and correlations, 
and finally apply some machine learning and neural network techniques, 
not only in real-world data but also in artificial data created with PyBAMM in python. 
Due to large data files only some representative scripts are included, 
some key figures/results and a report which wrapps the project as a whole.
